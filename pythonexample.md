# Python xfDNN Tutorial


## Introduction
This tutorial shows how to execute DNNs on the FPGA using our Python xfDNN API. We have included the GoogLeNet v1 and Resnet-50 models. We provide two examples of applications using the Python xfDNN API:

	1) A batch classification example that streams images from disk through the FPGA for classification.
	2) An example that shows different DNNs running on different PEs (cores) on the FPGA.
